1- exp_exp_tradeoff should not be assigned inside the code of def run, but rather inside the code of: only one line in run and
2- Change epsilon to update every episode not every iteration ! IMPORTANT !!!

#Reproducability test: Are same actions picked when running twice? (review random seed)
#Review Q-learning algorithms is similar to the one on the website.
#REview: Reward for different cases (different lanes, different final states: final reward seemed to be faulty earlier)

#TODO: if agent crosses by max_window: then assume car completed all the way as such (running getFollowSpeed several times)
  -- Our SingleAgentCase of this is to just let the simulation run and apply the final reward if the agent leaves first because the
	ambulance would be directly behind the agent.
