- Next Step:
	: Scenario Generation to find problems !
	: Coordination Between Agents (% of coordinating vehicles-> 0%, 20%, 40%..etc):
		* Same accelerations/velocities:-> Ambulance does not change its driving way
			in all experiments ! (smart vs non-smart)
- Start with base case that I can implement -> To more complex cases
- Scenario generation: lane beside me is slow due to truck

::: Single Agent Scenarios vs Multiagent as next step :::
Move from problem or move for surveying ?
Survey for scenario generation ?
